Overview

This project demonstrates creational design patterns in Java: Abstract Factory, Prototype, Builder, and Singleton. It models a transportation system with vehicles, loads, orders, projects, and a project manager, serving as a learning exercise.

Features

Abstract Factory: Creates compatible vehicle and load pairs (e.g., Tanker with LiquidFuel).



Prototype: Clones driver objects with specific capabilities.



Builder: Constructs complex objects (Order, Project) step-by-step.



Singleton: Ensures a single ProjectManager instance.
